# Facial-Recognition-using-CNN
Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to carry out the task of facial recognition. Based on the paper Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition we implemented a one-shot learning task for previously unseen objects. Given two facial images of previously unseen persons, our architecture determines whether they are the same person.
